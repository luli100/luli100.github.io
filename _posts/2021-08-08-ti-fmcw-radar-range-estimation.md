The module is going to start with explaining the basics of FMCW radar operation. And then focus primarily on range estimation using the radar. So the kind of questions that we will focus on in this module are: you have a radar, you have an object in front of it, how does the radar estimate the range to this object? What if there are multiple objects at different ranges from the radar? How close can two objects get and still hope to be resolved as always two objects? What determines the furthest distance that a radar can see?
